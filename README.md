# Project Sockshop on Terraform

Hello,

I'm working on Sockshop app ;\
To be able to create a full CI/CD I pushed all those folders into private Gitlab repositories.

Each folder contains terraform infrastructure files, which can be used on Gitlab thanks to .gitlab-ci.yml file.

Each part of AWS infrastructure can be re-used.

Goes with [my Sockshop app deployment plan](https://github.com/Sanourith/sockshop_microservices).
